The happiness of your life 
depends upon the quality of y
our thoughts: 
therefore, guard accordingly, 
and take care that you entertain no 
notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature. 
Marcus Aurelius

We are what our thoughts have made 
us; so take care about what you think. 
Words are secondary. Thoughts live; 
they travel far. 
Swami Vivekananda
